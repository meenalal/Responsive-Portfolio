                        A front-end developer's role is to combine design and business logic to achieve a user-facing
                        product.
                        To do this successfully, a wide skill set is necessary to produce a quality user experience
                        that leads to meeting business goals.

                        readability, loose coupling, maintainability and performance of your code when the business
                        user is breathing down your neck to release the next feature. But let me show you why it is
                        worthwhile to focus on what you check in and how it will save you time in the long run.

                        And then you find a problem that challenges your understanding of the framework and you begin
                        questioning yourself. Well, this is precisely one of those times.</p>
